            <p>Opportunity Classes (often called OC classes) are specialised, full‐time classes found in many NSW government primary schools. They are designed for intellectually gifted and high‐potential students who demonstrate advanced abilities compared to their age peers. Entry is determined by a placement test that is typically administered when a student is in Year 4, with successful candidates entering the opportunity class in Year 5 and continuing until Year 6.</p>

                    <p>The Opportunity Class Placement Test is designed to assess a student's ability rather than curriculum knowledge. It is computer‐based and comprises of three key sections, each contributing equally toward the overall test score:</p>

                        <li><strong>Test Centre Environment:</strong> The test is administered in external centres (often in local schools) with controlled conditions to ensure a fair testing environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Considerations:</strong> Do not bring your child to the test if they are unwell, especially if they exhibit symptoms of contagious illness. If unforeseen circumstances occur (e.g., sudden illness), parents should follow the provided procedures for submitting an illness or misadventure request.</li>

                    <p>To help your child feel confident and comfortable on test day:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Practice Tests:</strong> Encourage your child to use the online computer based practice tests as well as PDF practice test copies available on the NSW Department of Education website. Familiarity with the format and question style will help reduce test anxiety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Study with CS Resources:</strong> Use the resources we have provided from either WRMT and/or OC to retain knowledge and build familiarity with question types.</li>
                        <li><strong>Normal Routine:</strong> Ensure your child gets a good night's sleep the evening before and eats a healthy, balanced breakfast on the day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discuss the Process:</strong> Talk through what the day will involve so your child knows what to expect.</li>

                        <li><strong>Reading Test:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tip 1: Practice reading different types of texts and summarise the main idea in a few sentences. Additionally revise with any CS resources given to you.</li>
                                <li>Tip 2: Look for keywords in each passage; this helps when answering multiple-choice questions.</li>
                                <li>Tip 3: Practice managing time so that questions you find easier are quickly answered, leaving extra time for more complex passages.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Tip 1: Familiarise your child with word problems and real life math scenarios, practice mental calculations. Additionally revise with any CS resources given to you.</li>
                                <li>Tip 2: Remind them that no calculators are allowed; encourage estimation and checking work carefully.</li>
                                <li>Tip 3: Work through sample problems together to build strategies for solving different question types.</li>
                                <li>Tip 4: Practice managing time so that questions you find easier are quickly answered, leaving extra time for more complex questions.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Tip 1: Engage your child with simple puzzles and logic games to sharpen their problem solving skills. Additionally revise with any CS resources given to you.</li>
                                <li>Tip 2: Encourage them to eliminate clearly wrong answers when unsure of the correct choice.</li>
                                <li>Tip 3: Practice flagging questions to return to if time allows; this builds good test management habits.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Arrive Early: Ensure your child has plenty of time to settle in before the test starts.</li>

                                <li>Follow Instructions: Advise your child to read all instructions carefully and to ask for help (by raising their hand) if something is unclear.</li>
                                <li>Time Management: Practice pacing so that no section is rushed, and every question receives proper attention.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: Remember your child can not ask for any assistance on how to solve any questions or for meanings.</p>

                    <p>Opportunity Classes offer a unique environment where gifted and high‐potential students can thrive, learn with peers of similar ability, and be challenged beyond the standard curriculum. With the right preparation, your child can approach test day with confidence. Remember that the placement test is only one part of the overall process and if your child doesn't make it, then it is NOT the end of the line. There are many opportunities ahead to come like Selective and so on.</p>
